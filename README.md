# ACP for recognition "Eigenfaces"

_NB: Some ressources are in French_

## Topic
This topic was to study the ACP principle in the context of data analysis and scientific computation (in particular in the search for matrix eigenvalues).

## Project
This project was divided into three practical works.

### TP1
TP1 is about basics of ACP and data analysis.

It uses Matlab code.

### TP2
TP2 is about different methods to compute matrix engenvalues. Especially the power method and subspace iteration methods.

It uses Fortran 90 and Matlab code.

### TP3
TP3 reachs the final goal and deals with Engeifaces

It uses Matlab code.
